# Project4500
CIS4500 Project

Our idea for this project was motivated by the upcoming election and Pennsylvaniaâ€™s status as a critical swing state in the election. We have all been targeted with a flurry of political ads over the past few months and became curious about if it would be possible to quantify the amount of money it takes in political ad spending to convert a voter.
